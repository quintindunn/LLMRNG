# Analysis
## How the data will be analyzed
Each of the models will be tested in the following ways:
* Chi-Squared XYZ test

Additionally, all the numbers generated will be graphed on a histogram for a visual analysis. If a model was truly random, we'd expect to see a graph which is approximately evenly distributed.

Finally just for curiosity, each model's top 5, and bottom 5 most common numbers will be determined.

## Breakdown of the results:
